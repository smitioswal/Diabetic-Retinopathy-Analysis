# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Analysis

This is a team project made under the course IC-272 in IIT Mandi  

This project aims at:  
- Building a model with clinical potential using image classification, pattern recognition and deep learning  
- Working on simplifying the labor-intensive task of detecting diabetic retinopathy
- Aiming at increasing cost-effectiveness and accuracy of screening and diagnosis  

Here is an youtube video with our team members explaining the project in detail:
